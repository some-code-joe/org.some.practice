# org.some.practice
Just a place to put implementations or POCs by language. 

During an interview, I was asked if I had an actual strategy for learning new things. I do not really do anything that was not tied to work, thought being it would only matter if it could be proved out in real-world prod.

That being said, I do have some idea of exploring a new language or framework. Dividing by language then framework (and design pattern replication), I am just going to store that here when pecking through topics.
